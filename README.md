## Start Project

##### `git clone https://github.com/michael-orzel/firebase-login-system.git`
##### `cd firebase-login-system.git`
##### `npm install`
##### `npm start`

## Important!

For the project to run, you need to apply your firebase project's SDK to local environment variables. To do so, we put the project's config info in the provided `.env.example` file.
Once finished, make sure your .env.example file (or whatever you rename it to) is included in your .gitignore file so your project's info isn't uploaded when you go to build and deploy the app.

Now your project should be visible on your computer locally @ http://localhost:3000/
